# Project1 of CS50â€™s Web Programming with Python and JavaScript

**good to know:**

  - newest Version of Werkzeug didn't worked for me --> I used Werkzeug Verison 0.16.0
  - I'm using bootstrap 4.4.1 for styling
  - Rating on book page is shown in a radio item with "bad", "ok", ...
    When clicking on:
      - "bad" --> 1
      - "ok" --> 2
      - "good" --> 3
      - "very good" --> 4
      - "excellent" --> 5
     is stored in the database. The integer values are later on used to calculate the average rating on the api/<isbn>                        route
